# Altametrics Laravel + Vue (TS) Challenge

Hello and welcome to my challenge's GitHub repo!

Please go ahead and dive right in to my project. I have tried to streamline your experience, knowing that this is simply a coding challenge that needs to be reviewed.

First, clone the repo using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/alexcrisan1611/altametrics-laravel-vue-challenge.git
```

Then please go right in the `backend/` folder and read its readme to help you get started. The next step is getting the frontend ready. This is done by following the instructions in the readme inside `frontend/`.

I hope you'll enjoy!

Best regards,
Alex
